Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a)
Time Complexity: O(n) the number of operations directly relates to the size of n.
Space Complexity: O(1) the space complexity is a constant number.

b)
Time Complexity: O(n^2) [or more precisely, n^4], the number of operations increases quadratically based on n.
Space Complexity: O(1) the space complexity is a constant number.

c)
Time Complexity: O(n) the number of operations directly relates to the size of n.
Space Complexity: O(n) The amount of memory allocated directly relates to the size of n.


Exercise II:

f = n

O(1)
